# Beginner's Guide

## Price of a Coin
The price of any coin is all relative. It depends on how many total coins are available to the public. 
Price = Market Cap / Available Supply. 

## Market Cap 
Refers to the total dollar market value of a coin. It is calculated by multiplying the total number of available coins by the current market price of one coin. 
Market Cap = Available supply * Current Price 

## Total Supply of Coins
The company creates this number at launch. Some like bitcoin mint a certain amount of coins per day through mining, others like Ethereum have no max supply set and can print as much as they want, some like Cardano had an initial coin offering (ICO) which created all that will ever exist, while others like XRP minted the total number right in the beginning. 
Total supply = Market Cap / Current Price 

## Proof of work 
Examples: Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH)
Proof of work uses blockchain mining and is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort to solve an algorithm to prevent others from gaming the system. The first to solve the algorithm gets rewarded with the particular coin they are mining. Simply put, this means, a computer or set of computers runs a program to solve a mathematical puzzle. The first computer to solve it gets paid. The puzzle is a mathematical representation of all the transactions that took place on that one particular block. Once solved that block is recorded on the blockchain and the next puzzle begins. 

## Proof of Stake 
Example: Cardano (ADA)
Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism for blockchains to achieve distributed consensus. It requires users to stake their coins on a node. Based on the amount of coins staked blocks are assigned at random for the nodes to validate the transactions. Simply put, for each block one node is chosen to validate and distribute the information to the network. Validation is done the same way as proof of work by solving a mathematical computation. 

## Proof of work vs Proof of Stake
In proof of work – Everyone is competing to solve the block’s algorithm first. Once solved a new block starts and all the transactions that occurred during the previous block are recorded on the block chain.  
In Proof of Stake – Blocks are randomly assigned to stakeholders based on how many coins they have staked on the network. Once validated by the node they have their stake on the blocks is added to the blockchain. If the node is offline when it is their turn it gets randomly assigned to a new stakeholder.

Tax implications
Just like other forms of property like stocks, bonds, and real-estate, you incur capital gains or capital losses on your digital asset investments when you sell, trade, or otherwise dispose of your digital assets. Depending on what tax bracket you fall under, you will pay a certain percentage of tax on this capital gain. Keep in mind short term and long term capital gains will apply. The IRS uses a first in first out system (see definition). There are tax programs out there to track taxable events for you like www.cryptotrader.tax
First in first out 
Any time a taxable event occurs the IRS uses a first in first out scenario. For example: 
Jan 1 you buy: 0.1 BTC @ $10,000
Jan 20 you buy: 0.25 BTC  @ $15,000
Oct 10 you sell: 0.2 BTC @ $20,000
You will be taxed on 0.1 BTC at $10,000 & 0.1 BTC at $15,000 making your short term capital gains $15,000 ((20k – 10k)+(20k -15k)) 

## Types of Wallets
There are many ways to store your digital assets. On an exchange, on a desktop / mobile wallet, or on a hardware wallet. All of these examples fall into two categories, Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets. Internet connectivity defines a wallet in terms of hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the Internet and thus are less secure and pose more risks but are user friendly. Cold wallets, on the other hand, are stored offline and don’t require internet connectivity. Thus, improved security and less risk. 

## Wallets on an Exchange
Example: Coinbase
When your digital assets are on an exchange it is very convenient to buy, sell, or exchange your coins, but there are some drawbacks to keeping your money on an exchange. Exchanges are much like banks except they do not have FDIC insurance. While most exchanges do say they have some private insurance to cover your funds if the exchange is hacked you are trusting your funds to a private or public company. There have been many instances in the past where an exchange has been hacked and people have lost millions in assets. No wallet on an exchange allows you to view or hold your private keys (see private keys definition below). Keeping your digital assets on an exchange is very convenient, but is effectively equal to having an IOU. There are even some exchanges that do not allow you to move your money off of the exchange. 

## Desktop / Mobile Wallets
Examples: Exodus, Yoroi, Atomic Wallet
Desktop and Mobile wallets are also a form of a Hot Wallet because of the active internet connection, but you have much more control and it is much more secure in most cases. With a desktop or mobile wallet you can if you had an extra device air gap the device taking it offline, but in order to move your funds you will still need an active internet connection. While generally considered more secure, if your computer or phone is targeted in a hack you can lose all of your digital assets. The biggest difference between an exchange wallet and a desktop or hardware wallet is you do own your own private keys and you can take your wallet offline for more security.  

## Hardware Wallet
Examples: Ledger, Trezor 
Generally considered the most secure form of storing your digital assets. When your assets are stored on a hardware wallet they cannot be moved without the physical hardware wallet itself. Your digital assets are not stored on the hardware wallet though, the assets never leave the blockchain. The hardware wallet only stores your private keys. That private key is what opens the lock to your address on the blockchain allowing you to move or sell your funds. So, what happens if you lose your hardware wallet? Essentially, nothing, as long as you still have your Mnemonic keys (12 or 24 seed words) you can just buy another hardware wallet, restore it, and you will have full access to your assets again. 



## Private Key
Private keys are the key to your assets on the blockchain. Simply put, the private key unlocks your assets on the blockchain so you can do whatever you want with them. Your private key is the most important thing. If you lose it, you lose your funds forever as it is the only thing that can prove you own the assets on the blockchain. Not as simply put, private keys are a cryptographic string of numbers and letters. Example: E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262 memorizing this private key would be next to impossible. That is where Mnemonic keys come into play.

## Mnemonic keys
A mnemonic key or “your seed words” are a set of typically either 12 or 24 words that essentially take your complicated private key (example above) and translate it into 12 or 24 words that is much easier to remember or store. They are essentially the human readable version of your private key. Just like the private key though, if you lose your seed words you lose all access to your digital assets. A ledger or trezor, when you set up the device initially generates a mnemonic key for you. Any asset stored on the device shares that one seed word which is why you can back up all your funds with the seed words if you lose your device. 

## Two factor Authentication 
Examples: Authy, Google Authenticator 
Two Factor Authentication is essential for security. It is another layer of protection for you when you login. Even if your login and password were stolen, if you have two factor authentication enabled they could not steal your funds without access to the two factor authentication device. Authy and Google Authenticator are the two major apps you can download on your phone or computer. One big thing to note: Google Authenticator can only be added to one device. If you have two factor authentication enabled and lose that device you could lose all access to your funds. Authy offers multiple devices with the same login.
